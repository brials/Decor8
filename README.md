## Example Post

When making an appropriate api call you will get a matching response. Below are the parts of the call that you will need to include.

1. Header: You will need to include a header for most request 'including some get requests' that is of the following form.
```sh
Authorization: `Bearer ${yourTokenHere}`
```

2. Body: You will also need to make sure to send a valid body that we c an work with. If you don't you will get a 400 error.

3. ID: For most items that are not Posts and some that are you will need to provide proper Ids to access the items you want.

![Link](/images/dead-link.jpg)

4. If you do your route with all of those accounted for you should get an appropriate response. For example this is a category with no posts attached as it would be returned form a get request. If there were attached posts it would be populated.

```
  categoryType: 'test category',
  desc: 'test desc',
  _id: '58c870f9ad72fe4d9b69f9c1',
  postList: [],
  created: '2017-03-14T22:38:49.008Z'
```

### Cayla Zabel

Before learning how to code, Cayla was pursuing a career in the healthcare field. She has a passion to help people and wants to make an impact on both the community and the world. Cayla decided to look into coding because her brother is a successful software developer. She has been able to expose herself to the field. It was intriguing to watch an idea turn into a real application on the web. She chose JavaScript in particular because there is so much room for growth in the field. JavaScript is always changing which allows her to be a lifelong learner. Eventually Cayla wants to take her knowledge in technology and apply it to healthcare and have the ability to help people on a global scale with new applications.

My name is Jeremiah Walters and I am a Full-Stack JavaScript Developer.  I consider myself an User Experience Advocate.  Prior to programming I worked as a professional in the service industry for 8 years and a year ago I discovered that I have an empathetic passion for the user experience.

### Brian Alspach

Before coming to CodeFellows I worked as an Assistant Real Estate Manager at CBRE, Inc. I was able to work with clients to problem solve solutions for issues that came up. I enjoyed working to help people and still do. When dabbling with some code I discovered a real passion for the logic behind what makes a website run. As I have continued my journey into coding that passion has continued to grow. I chose to specialize in JavaScript because it is such a robust language has been a great base language to branch out to all the different things I want to do in coding. Ideally I see myself on a team of developers working with logic and data sto create applications that solve real issues.
